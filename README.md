# odin-landing-page
This was a project to test my abilities with flexbox and overall web design. 
I utulized html and css to create a basic recreation of the design provided by the Odin Project.
Overall I struggled at times and had to look a handful of things up, but it increased my understanding of the laguages significantly.
